# Final-Lab

Obed Johannes Final Lab for Intro to Python

My game runs and closes, all the text and images appear, and it doesnt crash.

This is my first ever coding class and my first github project. I spent first week working on the logic part of the game.
I was stuck on how to get the dice score to track when in a while loop. I moved on to working on the graphical part but ran into another problem 
there. The game has sever lag ive come to the conclusion that it has something to do with how my screen updated. I tried using .flip but that 
didnt seem to help the problem. I tried breaking the game up into different functions but was also unsure how to properly use them in the game
loop. I originally planned on drawing the dice individually using the built in functions but decided that bliting images would look cleaner.
I wasnt able to work out the kinks in both the graphical and logical part of my code but i did lay the framework for a craps game. I learned
so much more about python while working on this project. This was the first time I really felt like i was a coder. When i would get stuck I 
would teach myslef how to solve that problem.

The game unintentionally turned into a game of 7, 11 where you lose if you roll a (2, 3, or 12) and wi if you roll a 7 or 11. I tried setting it
up so it would save the first roll value but could not get it. The while loop would just rest it to zero. In wish a had a little more time to work out the bugs in the game but im still really proud of what I got done and how much I learned.

You also need the pygame pip downloaded on you text editor to run the game not sure how to include that in the repository so here is the link on
how to download it.( https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted )
