# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?
I want to code the game of craps. Mre and my roomates play it alot, its very simliar to the rules of real craps like the one you play at casinos but with minor differnces. 
I think coding a real game of craps would be more challenging for me than the one i play with my roomates as there are a few more rules that i would have to account for.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?
I dont really know anyone in class so i think ill be working by my self.

TODO

## Do you have any questions of your own?

If i have to pick another idea im willing to try to code 2d game but ive been looking into Unity and Unreal and it seems very overwhelming but im willing to try.
